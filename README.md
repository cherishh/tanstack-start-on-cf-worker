## Tanstack Start on Workers v0

### notes
- drizzle + neon is ok
  - you need `.dev.vars.production` & `.dev.vars` as your `.env` & `.env.local`. (shit. why does cf has to defined a new file???)
- can bind cf KV

### todo
- [ ] add theme
- [ ] setup shadcn/ui
- [ ] add auth
- [ ] ~~add analytics/posthog~~ not working for now, maybe other product
- [ ] add redis/upstash rate limit
- [ ] add logging/sentry
- [ ] sitemap
